## 🎯 Summary

### Attack Vectors Identified
1. JWT Token Theft and Access Control Bypass
2. SQL Injection with WAF Bypass
3. Phishing Campaign Targeting Internal Users

### Key Findings
-The activity originating from IP address 203.0.113.45 occurred outside the approved penetration testing schedule, confirming this was a genuine security breach rather than a planned test.
-Access control mechanisms were insufficient, allowing unauthorized viewing of multiple accounts via a stolen JWT token.
-The WAF failed to detect obfuscated SQL injection payloads, enabling successful data extraction totaling 892,341 bytes.
-Phishing awareness among internal users is inadequate, evidenced by multiple link clicks.
-Logging timestamps were inconsistent across sources, creating initial ambiguity during analysis.

### Top 3 Recommendations
1. Immediate Token Revocation and Session Reset
2. Enhance Access Control and WAF Protections
3. Strengthen User Security Awareness and Email Protections
